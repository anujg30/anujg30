Hi, I am Anuj.

I am a computational scientist at ValtedSeq where I apply and develop computational, statistical, machine and deep learning methods to single-cell RNA-seq data in order to discover novel biomarkers and drug targets for challenging neurodegenerative diseases.

I received my Ph.D. in from the Georgia Tech in 2021. In my academic life, I researched and developed new computational and statistical methods for processing, interpreting and understanding the large and heterogeneous biomedical datasets focussed on Malaria and other infectious diseases. I applied and developed novel Bioinformatics and Machine Learning driven solutions for various biological questions in order to address outstanding questions in cell biology, human health, and disease.

Feel free to explore my repository and if you are curious my webpage (https://anujg30.github.io/) has more info.

Cheers!!!
